Title: Customer Care Performance Analysis - Interactive Tableau Workbook


Overview: This Tableau project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the customer care performance, leveraging interactive and user-friendly visualizations. Through a series of data stories, users gain valuable insights into various aspects of customer care operations, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.




Project Objectives:




1. Analyze Ticket Volume Changes Over Time:

Develop visualizations to showcase ticket volume trends over the years.
Utilize time-series data to demonstrate fluctuations and patterns.
Enable users to interact with the data and explore specific timeframes.

2. Compare Local vs. Internet Ticket Volume:

Create dynamic visualizations to compare ticket volumes from different channels.
Implement filters for users to select specific periods or regions.
Offer drill-down capabilities to uncover underlying factors influencing ticket volume.

3. Assess Call Center Performance:

Integrate data on total calls, total tickets, calls abandoned, and calls answered.
Develop a comprehensive dashboard to display key performance metrics.
Enable data slicing to examine performance by different criteria such as time or agent.

4. Evaluate Trunk Service Factor (TSF) and Agent Availability:

Calculate TSF as a call center metric to assess service efficiency.
Incorporate historical data to compare TSF year-on-year.
Visualize agent availability alongside ticket volumes to identify potential correlations.

5. Analyze Average Handle Time (AHT):

Utilize historical AHT data to determine agent performance changes.
Generate a visual comparison of AHT between the current and previous year.
Facilitate the identification of areas needing optimization or training.

6. Draw Conclusions and Insights:

Develop a final data story to summarize the project's findings.
Provide clear explanations of the main differences in customer care performance.
Empower stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the analysis.




Benefits:

Enhanced Decision-Making: Stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to improve customer care strategies, resource allocation, and overall efficiency.
Interactive Experience: Users can interact with the visualizations, gaining deeper insights and exploring specific aspects of the data.
Improved Customer Satisfaction: By identifying pain points and performance gaps, businesses can enhance their services and address areas needing attention.




Data Sources: The project utilizes structured data sources, including historical ticket logs, call center metrics, agent performance records, and customer feedback. All data is securely stored and processed in Tableau for real-time access.




Conclusion: This Tableau workbook effectively showcases customer care performance analysis through interactive data stories. By enabling stakeholders to explore the data from multiple perspectives, the project facilitates informed decision-making and aids in devising strategies for delivering exceptional customer care services.
